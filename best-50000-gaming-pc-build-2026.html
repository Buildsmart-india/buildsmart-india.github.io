    <h2>Best ₹50,000 Gaming PC Build (2026)</h2>
    <p>This build is optimized for smooth 1080p gaming with balanced performance and upgrade potential.</p>

   <h2>Processor (CPU) – AMD Ryzen 5 5600</h2>
<p>
The Ryzen 5 5600 is a 6-core 12-thread processor that offers excellent gaming
performance in the ₹50,000 budget range. It delivers strong single-core
performance, which is important for gaming.
</p>

<p>
This CPU pairs well with the RX 6600 without causing significant bottleneck
at 1080p resolution. It also supports future upgrades on the AM4 platform.
</p>

    <h2>Motherboard</h2>
    <p>The B550 chipset motherboard represents the final, highly optimized, and most "future-proof" iteration of the AMD AM4 platform, bridging the gap between mainstream performance and next-gen features. It is designed to fully support 3rd Generation Ryzen, 4000 G-Series, and 5000 Series processors, providing a clear upgrade path for users looking to maximize the performance of their system without upgrading to the newer AM5 platform.</p>

    <h2>RAM</h2>
    <p>Upgrading from 16GB (2x8GB) to a higher capacity like 32GB on a B550 chipset motherboard is a direct way to improve multitasking, reduce stutters in AAA games, and handle professional workloads. While 16GB is often sufficient for standard tasks, 32GB is increasingly considered the "gold standard" for modern gaming and content creation.</p>

    <h2>Graphics Card (GPU)</h2>
    <p>The AMD Radeon RX 6600 is an entry-level graphics card designed for exceptional 1080p performance, offering modern features and high energy efficiency.The Radeon RX 6600 is engineered for high-refresh-rate 1080p gaming and can even handle 1440p in less demanding titles..</p>

    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>A 500GB NVMe SSD is the ideal choice for a primary boot drive on a B550 motherboard, offering a massive performance leap over traditional SATA drives and hard disks. By leveraging the PCIe 4.0 interface available on B550 boards, these drives can achieve read speeds up to 7,400 MB/s, significantly reducing wait times for system startup and heavy application launches</p>

    <h2>Power Supply</h2>
    <p>A 550W 80+ Bronze PSU provides a reliable and cost-effective power foundation for mid-range gaming builds, ensuring your components receive stable voltage while maintaining at least 85% efficiency under typical loads..</p>
    <h2>Expected Gaming Performance (1080p)</h2>
<ul>
<li>GTA V – High Settings: 90+ FPS</li>
<li>Valorant – High Settings: 200+ FPS</li>
<li>Cyberpunk 2077 – Medium Settings: 60 FPS</li>
</ul>
    <h2>Future Upgrade Options</h2>
<p>
You can upgrade to 32GB RAM later. The B550 motherboard also supports
higher-end Ryzen CPUs if you want more performance.
